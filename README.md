# CS:GO DUELS
Gamemode for CS:GO what mix deathmatch + 1v1 gamemode
***
## About duels

The concept behind Duels is to create realistic 1v1 situations that can occur on maps played in tournaments like Dust2, Mirage, Cache, Overpass, Train etc. It’s a brand new(ish) tool for practice and is primarily focused on positioning, peaking, and map knowledge. Knowing how to peak someone, how to clear angles with quick peaks etc.
You can of course say that Deathmatch is just that but let me remind you that Deathmatch has its faults. Who hasn’t been enraged just because you immediately die after you spawned or when you are shot in the back over and over again? Often, you shoot players from behind and think you are the king of CS, but really, what does that do for you in terms of improving? Duels have none or very limited of that. You can say that Duels is a mix between Arena 1on1 and Deathmatch with instant spawns. Best of two worlds.
